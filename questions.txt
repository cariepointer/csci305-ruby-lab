10. The word "cat" gives the title: "cat blues for the world is a little girl in the world is a little girl in the world is"
    The word "dog" gives the title: "dog blues for the world is a little girl in the world is a little girl in the world is"
    The word "me" gives the title: "me to the world is a little girl in the world is a little girl in the world is a"
    The word "they" gives the title: "they say goodbye to the world is a little girl in the world is a little girl in the world"
    The word "cactus" gives the title: "cactus jack the world is a little girl in the world is a little girl in the world is a"
    The word "lo" gives the title: "lo que te quiero ser feliz navidad negra tomasa"

    "is a little girl in the world" is the most common phrase I have noticed. Since "is" follows a lot of words, once it
    is added to the song title, the words following it will be the same. "for" is also another word that is common. Common words
    such as "are" "they" "the" "a" "in" make the song titles run in a pattern
